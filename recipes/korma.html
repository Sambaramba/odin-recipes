        <h2>Description</h2>" 
        <p>This is an <strong>easy vegetable and paneer Korma recipe</strong>. Indian/south asian cusine is some of my favourite foods as I find the meals comforting, not too unhealthy and I love the spice combinations. This Korma is full of vegetables and spices for nutrients and has paneer for a decent main protein source.</p>
        <p>You can use any kind of vegetables if you dont like any in the recipe, but if using root vegetables they will need to be par boiled first</p>
