        <li><strong>While the vegetables are in the oven</strong>,heat the remaining oil in a large sized pan and gently fry the onion for 5 minutes,stirring regularly.</li>
        <li><strong>Add the chilli and remaining garlic</strong> and cook for another minute,then stir in the tomatos,herbs and crumbled stock cube/stock. Bring to the boil then simmer for 30 minutes until the sauce has reduced a bit. Add the spinach 3 minutes before the 30 minutes is up. When sauce is sufficiently reduced add balsmic vinegar and season to taste.</li>

            <!-- <h3>For the bechamel sauce</h3> -->
        <li><strong>Take vegetables out of oven </strong>,then along with the lentils, add to the pan of tomato sauce and combine. Add olives and sun-dried tomatos too if using.</li>

Top with another third of the vegetable mixture (doesn't matter if it doesn't cover evenly) and a second layer of lasagne sheets.</li>
        <li>Now pour over just under half of the cheese sauce and very gently top with the remaining vegetable mixture. Finish with a final layer of lasagne sheets and the rest of the cheese sauce. Sprinkle with the cheddar cheese.</li>
