        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This is a recipe for a <strong><em>healthy vegan tomato sauce</em></strong> that is quite easy to make and packed full of flavour. The sauce can be eaten with pasta or used in recipes such as lasagne or canneloni. The combination of the sweetness from balsamic vinegar and the tangyness from the tomatoes is lovely. </p>
            <p>Preparation is about <strong><em>10-15 minutes</em></strong> and total cooking time is about <strong><em>1 hour</em></strong>.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ol>
            <li><strong> Add garlic to a small pan </strong>, in a single layer, and cover with oil. Then place over a low heat for 20 mins or until just starting to turn golden.</li>
            <li><strong>Whilst garlic is cooking. </strong> Heat a large frying pan on a medium-high heat, with a little oil. Add mushrooms in a single layer and cook for a 2-3 minutes on each side to release moisture, then take pan off heat and leave to the side.</li>
            <li><strong>When the mushrooms have started cooking </strong>Heat a large pan on a low-medium heat, then add the onions and leave for 5 minutes to soften.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the mushrooms and chilli to the onions</strong> and cook for a few more minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Pour the garlic with the oil to the onions. </strong> Add sun-dried tomatos and olives as well if using. Then cook for a further 2 minutes.</li>
            <li><strong>Add the cannelini beans,herbs and chopped tomatos </strong> and bring to the boil. Then turn down to a simmer and allow the sauce to reduce for 30 minutes (or longer if you like a thicker sauce).</li>
