# recipe-website-odin-project
This is my first Odin project in which I am tasked to create a recipe website. This website will have a homepage and at least 3 other webpages with recipes on them. The homepage will link to the 3+ recipes. The recipes will include an image a description of the recipe,a list of ingredients and steps to make it.

The skills that I have demonstrated are html-boilerplates,different headings,ordered and unordered lists,paragraphs, strong and emphasised elements for text,webpage links and images,and some fractions.
