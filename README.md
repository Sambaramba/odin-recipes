# recipe-website-odin-project
This is my first Odin project in which I am tasked to create a recipe website. This website will have a homepage and at least 3 other webpages with recipes on them. The homepage will link to the 3+ recipes and all the recipes will have images of them on the page.

The skills that I have demonstrated are html-boilerplates,headings,ordered and unordered lists,paragraphs, stong and emphasised text,webpage links and images.
